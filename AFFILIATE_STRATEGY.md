# 🚀 GameZone Affiliate Approval Strategy

You have a professional-looking site with the technical foundation laid out. However, approval is not guaranteed by design alone. Affiliate networks (like Amazon Associates, CJ, Impact, ShareASale) look for **Traffic**, **Trust**, and **Content**.

Here is your step-by-step roadmap to getting accepted.

---

## Phase 1: Content Saturation (Week 1)
**Goal:** Look like an active, established publication, not a template.

1.  **Complete the Game Database**:
    *   We only updated the top 6 games with unique descriptions. You **MUST** update the rest of the `games.js` file.
    *   **Action:** Go through every single game in `src/data/games.js` and write a unique 3-4 sentence description and 4 unique Pros/Cons.
    *   *Why:* If a reviewer clicks "Minecraft" and sees the same text as "GTA V", you will be rejected for "Duplicate Content".

2.  **Create a "Blog" or "News" Section (Optional but Recommended)**:
    *   Affiliates love dynamic content. A static list of games looks dead.
    *   **Action:** Consider adding a simple "News" section where you post 1-2 articles like "Top 10 Games of 2024" or "Upcoming RPGs to Watch".

## Phase 2: Traffic Generation (Weeks 2-4)
**Goal:** Show that real people visit your site.
*Most programs require a working website with active traffic.*

1.  **Social Proof**:
    *   Create real Instagram and X (Twitter) accounts for "GameZone".
    *   Post screenshots of your game reviews.
    *   Link these accounts in your footer (replace the current links).

2.  **Seed Traffic**:
    *   You don't need millions of visitors, but you need *some*.
    *   Share your reviews on Reddit (e.g., r/gaming, r/webdesign - asking for feedback), Discord servers, or social media.
    *   **Metric to aim for:** 50-100 unique visitors before applying.

## Phase 3: The Application Process (Week 4+)
**Goal:** Apply to the *right* programs first.

1.  **Start Small (Tier 1)**:
    *   Don't go for the biggest exclusive networks yet. Start with easier approvals.
    *   **Amazon Associates**: Easy to join, but you must make 3 sales in 180 days to stay.
    *   **Kinguin / G2A / CDKeys**: These are game key resellers. They are often easier to get into than official publisher programs.

2.  **The Application Pitch**:
    *   When asked "How will you promote us?", use this template:
    > "We are a dedicated game review platform (GameZone) focusing on high-quality, in-depth reviews of modern PC and Console titles. We drive traffic through SEO-optimized review pages and an active social media community. We intend to use affiliate links within our 'Verdict' and 'Buy Now' sections to help our readers purchase the games we recommend."

## Phase 4: Technical Polish (Ongoing)
**Goal:** Zero errors during the review.

1.  **Broken Link Check**:
    *   Click EVERY button on your site. If one leads to a 404, fix it.
2.  **Mobile Check**:
    *   Open your site on your phone. Does it look perfect? 50% of traffic is mobile.
3.  **Speed**:
    *   Ensure your images are optimized (we are using CDN links, which is good).

---

## 🚩 "Red Flags" to Avoid (The "Do Not" List)
*   **DO NOT** use AI-generated gibberish for reviews. Edit it to sound human.
*   **DO NOT** copy-paste reviews from IGN or Gamespot. You will be banned for copyright.
*   **DO NOT** claim to be "The #1 Gaming Site" if you just started. Be humble but professional.
*   **DO NOT** leave "Lorem Ipsum" text anywhere.
