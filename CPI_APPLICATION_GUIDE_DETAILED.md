# Complete CPI Affiliate Application Guide - Step by Step

## 🎯 How CPI Programs Work (Simple Explanation)

### Traditional Affiliate vs CPI:

**Traditional (Commission) Model:**
```
You promote game → User buys for $60 → You get 5% = $3
Problem: User must spend money (low conversion)
```

**CPI (Cost Per Install) Model:**
```
You promote game → User downloads FREE → You get $1-3
Benefit: No purchase needed (high conversion!)
```

### How You Get Paid:

1. **You sign up** to CPI network
2. **You get unique tracking link** for each game
3. **User clicks your link** from your website
4. **User downloads/installs game** (tracked via cookies/pixels)
5. **Network confirms install** (usually within 24 hours)
6. **Your account credited** with $1-3 per install
7. **You cash out** when you reach minimum payout

### Why It's Better for Gaming Sites:

✅ **Higher conversion** - 10-20x more people download free games vs buy games  
✅ **Fixed payment** - You know exactly what you'll earn per action  
✅ **No purchase barrier** - Users don't need credit cards  
✅ **Easier to scale** - More volume = more money  
✅ **Better user experience** - You're helping users find free games
