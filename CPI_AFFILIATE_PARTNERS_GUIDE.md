## How CPI/CPA Works (Simple Explanation)

### Traditional Commission Model (What You DON'T Want):
```
User clicks link → Buys $60 game → You get 5% = $3
Problem: User has to spend money for you to earn
```

### CPI/CPA Model (What You WANT):
```
User clicks link → Downloads FREE game → You get $1-3
Benefit: User doesn't spend money, you still earn!
```

- **Conversion Rate**: 5% click through to download
- **Downloads**: 50 per month

- **Monthly Earnings**: **$100**

### With 5,000 Monthly Visitors:
- **Conversion Rate**: 5% click through
- **Downloads**: 250 per month
