## 🚀 Paid Traffic Strategy (Optional)

**Wait until you have:**
- 1,000+ organic visitors/month
- Proven RPC of at least $0.50
- Content that converts at 3%+ CTR

### **Where to Advertise**

**Facebook/Instagram Ads** (Best ROI for mobile games):
- Target: 18-35, interested in mobile gaming
- Ad format: Video ads showing gameplay
- Budget: Start with $5-10/day
- Break even: If install rate > your cost per click

**Example:**
- Spend: $5/day = $150/month
- Clicks: 150 clicks (at $1 CPC)
- Installs: 45 installs (at 30% install rate)
- Revenue: 45 × $2 CPI = $90
- Result: -$60 loss (need better optimization)

Better spend on organic growth initially.

**Reddit Ads** (Cheaper, targeted):
- r/AndroidGaming, r/iosgaming
- $0.10-0.50 CPC
- More affordable testing ground

**TikTok Ads** (High engagement):
